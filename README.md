# DOSdisklib
DOS low level disk access library for 32 bit DPMI (remember that?) in TMT or Free Pascal. Don't get too excited. For historical interest mostly. Includes 'cld' utility, like 'cls' for clear screen... but for your disks.

If you're looking at a DOS emulator or doing some kind of forensics you may find useful info in the 'pdisk32' library code. Some of that stuff was hard information to track down at the time.
